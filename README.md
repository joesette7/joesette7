- 👋 Hello world my name is Joe 

- 👀 I’m interested in distributed systems, Ethereum, Defi/Gamefi, building DApps, and Smart Contracts.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic C++, Java, JS, Python, Solidity | Very interested in learning more about Smart Contracts.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DApp production(Smart Contracts, UI's, API's, and interacting with EVM and other web3 components).

- 📫 Please feel free to reach me at joe.sette27@gmail.com. I am super excited about this work and collaborating w/ others who have similar interests.
